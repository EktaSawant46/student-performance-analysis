## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and
**basic data visualization** on a student performance dataset using **Python**.

The goal is to understand the dataset, clean inconsistent values, and visualize
patterns related to student performance as part of a **beginner data analyst
learning journey**.
